<h1> The Targets </h1>
<br>
The responsibility for bullying always falls on the bully's shoulders, not the victim's. Nonetheless, there are a number of types of kids who are often the target of bullies. These are characteristics or attributes that might make bullying more likely.
<br>
ꫀSuccessful<br>
Kids who are good at what they do might get bullied. A lot of times kids will be bullied because they get a lot of positive attention from their peers and from adults.This attention could be everything from excelling in sports to making the cheerleading squad to getting the editor’s position on the school newspaper.
<br>
Bullies target these students because they either feel inferior or they worry that their abilities are being overshadowed by the target’s abilities. As a result, they bully these kids hoping to make them feel insecure as well as to make others doubt their abilities.
<br>

ꫀIntelligent, Determined, Creative<br>
At school, these students go that extra mile on schoolwork. Or they learn very quickly and move through projects and assignments faster than other students. For instance, gifted students are often targeted for excelling in school. Bullies usually single them out because they are jealous of this attention.
<br>

ꫀVulnerable<br>
Children who are introverted, anxious, or submissive are more likely to be bullied than kids who are extroverted and assertive. In fact, some researchers believe that kids who lack self-esteem may attract kids who are prone to bully. What's more, kids who engage in people-pleasing are often targeted by bullies because they are easy to manipulate.
<br>
ꫀDistinctive Physical Appearance<br>
Almost any type of physical characteristic that is different or unique can attract the attention of bullies.It may be that the victim is short, tall, thin, or obese. They might wear glasses or have acne, a large nose, or ears that stick out. It really doesn't matter what it is, the bully will pick a feature and distort it into a target.
<br>
Many times, this type of bullying is extremely painful and damaging to a young person's self-esteem. Most bullies who target these kids get some enjoyment from making fun of others. Other times, they are looking for a laugh at another person's expense. The best way to combat a bully who targets this type of person is to take away their audience.
<br>
ꫀIllness or Disability<br>
Bullies often target special needs children.This can include children who have autism spectrum disorder (ASD), Asperger's syndrome (which the DSM-5 no longer uses as a diagnosis but, instead, now falls under ASD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), dyslexia, Down syndrome, or any condition that sets them apart. Kids with food allergies, asthma, and other conditions also can be targeted by bullies. When this happens, the bullies show a lack of empathy or are making jokes at another person's expense.
<br>
It is very important for teachers and parents to make sure these kids have a support group with them to help defend against bullying. It also helps if the general student population frowns on this type of bullying in particular. If bullies know this is taboo, they are less likely to do it.
<br>
ꫀDifferent Sexual Orientation<br>
More often than not, kids are bullied for being gay.In fact, some of the most brutal bullying incidents have involved children who are bullied for their sexual orientation. If left unchecked, prejudicial bullying can result in serious hate crimes. As a result, it is essential that lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) students be given a solid support network in order to keep them safe.
<br>
ꫀReligious or Cultural Beliefs<br>
It is not uncommon for kids to be bullied for their religious beliefs. One example of this type of bullying includes the treatment Muslim students received after the 9/11 tragedy. However, any student can be bullied for their religious beliefs. Both Christian students and Jewish students are often ridiculed for their beliefs and practices as well.
<br>
ꫀBullying based on different religious beliefs usually stems from a lack of understanding as well as a lack of tolerance for believing something different.
<br>
ꫀDifferent Race<br>
Sometimes kids will bully others because they are of a different race.15﻿ For instance, White students may single out Black students and bully them. Or Black students may single out White students and bully them.
<br>
It happens with all races and in all directions. No race is exempt from being bullied, and no race is exempt from having bullies. Just like with religious bullying, these students are singled out for no other reason than the fact that they're different.

  <li>Encourage kids to speak to a trusted adult if they are bullied or see others being bullied. The adult can give comfort, support, and advice, even if they can’t solve the problem directly. Encourage the child to report bullying if it happens.</li>
  <li>Talk about how to stand up to kids who bully. Give tips, like using humor and saying “stop” directly and confidently. Talk about what to do if those actions don’t work, like walking away

  <li>Urge them to help kids who are bullied by showing kindness or getting help.</li>
